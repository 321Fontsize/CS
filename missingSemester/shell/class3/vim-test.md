Writing English words and writing code are very different activities. When programming, you spend more time switching files, reading, navigating, and editing code compared to writing a long stream. It makes sense that there are different types of programs for writing English words versus code (e.g. Microsoft Word versus Visual Studio Code).

As programmers, we spend most of our time editing code, so it’s worth investing time master an editor that fits your needs. Here’s how you learn a new editor:

Start with a tutorial (i.e. this lecture, plus resources that we point out)
Stick with using the editor for all your text editing needs (even if it slows you down initially)
Look things up as you go: if it seems like there should be a better way to do something, there probably is
If you follow the above method, fully committing to using the new program for all text editing purposes, the timeline for learning a sophisticated text editor looks like this. In an hour or two, you’ll learn basic editor functions such as opening and editing files, save/quit, and navigating buffers. Once you’re 20 hours in, you should be as fast as you were with your old editor. After that, the benefits start: you will have enough knowledge and muscle memory that using the new editor saves you time. Modern text editors are fancy and powerful tools, so the learning never stops: you’ll get even faster as you learn more.
